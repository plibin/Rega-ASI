implement into the SOP file 


Some of explanation below is also in the SOP
##################################################

documentation : 
	Rega_HIV1_Rules.doc  (OLD version, not part of documentation, base for branches document, so do not delete); for newer versions see branches for version 
	-SOP270-Updating-resistance-algorithms.md
	- rega-algorithm-rules-document.md
	
	
way set up: all documentation maintained on master branch but
	release and code of xml is other branches (version-specific). 
	so in a branch, you do not see master documentation 
	
	
update on documentation; do it on the master 



Master: xml ; old not the most current one. (should be removed) 




# SOP270-Updating-resistance-algorithms.md
changes ; generic for any version 


# rega-algorithm-rules-document.md (unique)
information taken from word file from clinician (rule creator) 
version specific 


Remove from master
-	Rega_HIV1_Rules.doc
-   

## define change w.r.t. old version
## each difference from version x to version y  -> create issue (copy paste subset  from rega-algorithm-rules-document.md) 
## go latest branch, 
	implement change in the doc file (pdf) and in  the xml file in the new version branch 
	test and quality check 
	close the issue (reference issue # in the commit); handy directional relationship
	
	
## release of new version = new branch 
bugs of this release should be in this branch 



## strategy: branch new version never disappears or is renamed. When a new version is mature, branch it off and give it the specifkc # version name. 
And tag as new release. but branch 'new version' is just a cumulative repo of all changes , across all changes. 



## VERSION 11  is still 'new version' 
some changes of 11 already in 'new version' 
but incomplete. 

which are still to do? check the # of issues outstanding
