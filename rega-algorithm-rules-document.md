***Comments: gag mutations added. One serious doubt: should the
intermediate resistance score stay at 2 or rise to 2,5? It looks to me
that we’re reaching the intermediate level too fast.***

***Comments: completely new set of rules***

Proposal for Rilpivirine rules, based on:
-----------------------------------------

1.  Mutations selected *in vitro* under drug pressure;

2.  Mutations selected *in vivo* in Rilpivirine Clinical Trials;

3.  Mutations studied *in vitro* with a phenotypic impact in Rilpivirine
    activity;

4.  Reports from the mutation's patterns at virological failure in
    patients taking Rilpivirine.

High Level Resistance: score at least 2,5

Intermediate Resistance: score at least 1,5

i\. Add 3 to the score for every mutation or group of mutations in the
following list: K101P, (K101E+M184I/V), (K103N+L100I), (E138K+M184I/V),
Y181I, Y181V, Y188L.

i.i. Add 1,5 to the score for every mutation in the following list:
K101E, E138A, E138G, E138Q, E138S, E138K, E138R, V179L, Y181C, H221Y,
F227C, M230I/L

i.i.i. Add 0,5 to the score for every mutation in the following list:
V90I, K101Q/T, K103S, V106A/I, V108I, V179D, V179T, V179I, V189I, G190E.

Proposal of rules for interpretation of Elvitegravir resistance
---------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Mutations selected *in vitro* under drug pressure;

2.  Mutations selected *in vivo* in Elvitegravir Clinical Trials;

3.  Mutations studied *in vitro* with a phenotypic impact in
    Elvitegravir activity;

4.  Reports from the mutation's patterns at virological failure in
    patients taking Elvitegravir

High level resistance: score at least 2

Intermediate resistance: score at least 1

i\. Add 2 to the score for every mutation in the following list:
T66A/I/K, E92Q/G, P145S, Q146I/L/P/R, S147G, Q148H/K/R, N155H/S/T.

i.i. Add 1 to the score for every mutation in the following list: F121Y,
G140S/A/C.

i.i.i. Add 0,5 to the score for every mutation in the following list:
H51Y, T97A, H114Y, Q146K, S153F/Y, R263K.

GSS: Susceptible = 1
