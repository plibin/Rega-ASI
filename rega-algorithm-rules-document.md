***Comments: gag mutations added. One serious doubt: should the
intermediate resistance score stay at 2 or rise to 2,5? It looks to me
that we’re reaching the intermediate level too fast.***

***Comments: completely new set of rules***

Proposal for Rilpivirine rules, based on:
-----------------------------------------

1.  Mutations selected *in vitro* under drug pressure;

2.  Mutations selected *in vivo* in Rilpivirine Clinical Trials;

3.  Mutations studied *in vitro* with a phenotypic impact in Rilpivirine
    activity;

4.  Reports from the mutation's patterns at virological failure in
    patients taking Rilpivirine.

High Level Resistance: score at least 2,5

Intermediate Resistance: score at least 1,5

i\. Add 3 to the score for every mutation or group of mutations in the
following list: K101P, (K101E+M184I/V), (K103N+L100I), (E138K+M184I/V),
Y181I, Y181V, Y188L.

i.i. Add 1,5 to the score for every mutation in the following list:
K101E, E138A, E138G, E138Q, E138S, E138K, E138R, V179L, Y181C, H221Y,
F227C, M230I/L

i.i.i. Add 0,5 to the score for every mutation in the following list:
V90I, K101Q/T, K103S, V106A/I, V108I, V179D, V179T, V179I, V189I, G190E.

***Comments: correction of typing error in score 2 (it was 20 in the
previous version of the algorithm); added mutations 143/K/S, N155T,
T66K, E92V, G118R, F121Y, V151L, G140C, E157Q, S230N/R, R263K.***

G163K are now scored 0,5***

***Positions 206 and 232 are highly polymorphic; mutations at these
positions were now excluded.***
